# Master Thesis: Kubernetes Forensics

This repository serves as a static repo that hosts my master thesis on [Kubernetes Forensics](Kubernetes-Forensics.pdf). It furthermore includes the examples and several other files that are needed in order to follow along the tests or work on enhancements. :) 

In order to view the files specific to an analyzed scenario, decompress them using `tar -xzvf` or whatever fits your needs. :)

Note: When extracted, the size of this repo will be around 3.9GB. 

The files `_checksums.*` contain checksums of all files, including extracted ones.

## Work on enhancements

If you are interested in working on enhancements, please take a look at the framework which has been developed in the course of my thesis: [PowerForensicator](https://github.com/pr3l14t0r/PowerForensicator).

Also you might want to take a look on my PowerShell wrapper for VirtualBox commands: [Vbox4Pwsh](https://github.com/pr3l14t0r/Vbox4Pwsh).

Enhancements are always welcome!
